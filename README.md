Below are the problems and brief descriptions of the solutions available in this repository:

ASSIGNMENT 2 :-

âœ…1. Estimate the Value of Pi using Monte Carlo Method
Description: Monte Carlo simulation to estimate Pi's value by random sampling.

âœ… 2. Matrix Multiplication (70x70) Comparison
Description:
Perform matrix multiplication using both serial and parallel (MPI) approaches and compare execution time.

âœ… 3. Parallel Sorting using MPI (Odd-Even Sort)
Description:
Implements the Odd-Even transposition sort algorithm in parallel using MPI.

âœ… 4. Heat Distribution Simulation
Description: Simulates heat distribution across a 2D grid using parallel computation.

âœ… 5. Parallel Reduction using MPI
Description: Demonstrates parallel reduction operation (sum) using MPI_Reduce.

âœ… 6. Parallel Dot Product using MPI
Description: Computes the dot product of two vectors in parallel.

âœ… 7. Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan) using MPI
Description: Computes the prefix sum (scan operation) using parallel MPI methods.

âœ… 8. Parallel Matrix Transposition using MPI
Description: Performs matrix transposition in parallel using MPI.


ASSIGNMENT 3 :-

âœ… Q1. DAXPY Loop using MPI
Description: Implements the DAXPY operation X[i] = a * X[i] + Y[i] where X and Y are vectors of size 2^16.

âœ… Q2. Calculation of Ï€ using MPI Bcast and MPI Reduce
Description: Parallel computation of Ï€ (Pi) using numerical integration.

âœ… Q3. Prime Number Finder using MPI_Recv
Description: Parallel prime number search up to a given maximum using master-slave communication with MPI_Recv.


ASSIGNMENT 1 :-

âœ… Q1. Random Walking using MPI
Description: Simulates random walkers moving across a distributed domain. Walkers crossing the local boundary are sent to the next process using MPI_Send, with wrap-around at the last process. Demonstrates inter-process communication

ASSIGNMENT 4 :-

âœ… Q1. Sum of First N Integers Using CUDA
Description: Write a program using CUDA, in which all the threads are performing different
tasks. These task are as follows:
a. Find the sum of first n integer numbers. (you can take n as 1024. Do not use direct
formula but use iterative approach)
b. Find the sum of first n integer numbers. (You can take n as 1024. You can use direct
formula not the iterative approach)

âœ… Q2. Parallel Merge Sort Using CUDA
Description: Implement merge sort to sort the element of an array of the size n=1000.
a. To implement parallelization use pipelining.
b. Now implement the parallel merge sort using CUDA.
c. Compare the performance of both (a) and (b) methods.

ASSIGNMENT 5:- 

âœ… Q1. Basic Vector Addition Using CUDA
Description: Write a CUDA program for very basic implementation of vector addition kernel.
Compute the profiling of object using nvprof
